Epitech project, parralax game

The Epitech TekAdventure Project
So this is a completly graphical project, means that, you do not need to run any 
spécific parameter with the binray generated with the Makefile.
This is a game using parralax and random events, you'll need to solve a puzzle game, that you'll
find in the "map" file, all the maps are linked with portals (or not, its up to you).
You'll need to reach the end of the game to win.
You can move using arrow keys, or let the IA guide you, just right clic somewhere on the screen, 
and your character will try to reach this position.
You can grab the window and move it, using CTRL + left click, and then drag the window,
by clicking right into the screen.
Press R to reset the position of the camera.
The game provides a Multiplayer mode, if you want to play alone, host a game and click "start".
When you create your character, it will be automaticly saved in a "player.dat" file, with its name, 
skin, and different properties that will be automaticly load at the next launch.
The last IP that you joined, is saved too :)
You'll probably need to Press Enter twice to join a game (not everyone is perfect).

took 32 hours to make.
